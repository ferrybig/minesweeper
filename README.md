# Breakout

This is a Javascript breakout game. This game was made to demonstrate my knowledge about the Javascript module pattern.

## Input

This game allows for differend methods of input:

 - Mouse
 - Keyboard arrow keys
 
To prevent the keyboard and mouse from looking really fast, there is a small smoothing effect applied so its looks visually more pleasing.

## Cheats

Activate from console

 - `Powerup.activatePower("exploding")` - Explode on impact
 - `Powerup.activatePower("flythru")` - Fly thru blocks
 - `Powerup.activatePower("holdball")` - The paddle holds the ball
